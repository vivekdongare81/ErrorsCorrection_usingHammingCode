# ErrorsCorrection_usingHammingCode

A Task consists of implementing Hamming Code on a web page with backend support, which is used to Encode bitstream and Decodes it into original bitstream even if errors occurred in certain limit. It can detect 2 bit error and correct a single bit error in each group (depends on version of HC applied) if may occur while transmission of data. <br/>


## Prerequisite 

- Tomcat Server, Java SE 8 (JDK 1.8)

## Installation to Run Locally


 -  Step 1 - Clone the project and navigate to the project directory
  
```bash
git init 
git clone < repo link >

```


  -  Step 2 - Run home.jsp with Tomcat server 

```bash
 >> home.jsp

```

URL - [http://localhost:8080/ErrorDetectionNCorrection/homeServelet]


## Demo

- Select version of Hamming code from checklist to be used to Encode Bitstream.

- Input bitstream to be Encoded and press ENCODE.

- Result will appear as Encoded bitstream with other req details.

        *** Suppose the error occured in Encoded stream due to Transmission or any other cause. 1111010010 --> 1011010110 ***
        

        * CASE 1:  Resulted output is Original Bitstream after correcting single errors.

        * CASE 2:  Resulted output as Double error detected,can't decode further (Gives Total no of Errors detected).
